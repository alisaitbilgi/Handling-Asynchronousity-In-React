# Handling-Asynchronousity-In-React (Promise-based)

	In this presentation,I tried to answer 4 main questions to cover async concept in React:

1) How to handle 'asynchronousity' in React Applictions ? 

2) Bad Practices, Good Practices, Better Practices ? (The way we'll reach 'Redux-Thunk' and pros-cons of each step)  

3) Do we really need "Redux-Thunk Middleware"? What does it solve? And actually, what is a "middleware"?

4) Understanding and using Redux-Thunk


 
 	#We'll make same, simple async operation 6 times with 6 different ways and evaluate pros-cons of each step.

	(Async Operation: show a notificiation to user when logged in, and then hide it after 5 seconds.)
